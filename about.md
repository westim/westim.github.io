Hi, I'm Tim and this is where I talk about my adventure through the intangible world of software.

I always loved computers. I grew up surrounded by Gateway computers and spent many hours with The Incredible Machine and Railroad Tycoon.

I'm currently an engineer with [Hologic, Inc.](http://www.hologic.com), working to improve the quality of women's health by developing automated testing frameworks for mammography devices.
