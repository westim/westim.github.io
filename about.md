Hi, I'm Tim and this is where I host my adventures through the intangible world of software.

I always loved computers. I grew up surrounded by Gateway computers and spent many hours with The Incredible Machine and Railroad Tycoon.

I'm currently a software engineer with [NuVasive, Inc.](http://www.nuvasive.com) working on improving spine surgery patient outcomes through the use of advanced technology.
